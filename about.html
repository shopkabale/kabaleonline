        </div>
        
        <p class="about-story">My journey with Kabale Online started when I was reporting for my first year at university. I had very little money, but I needed to furnish my small room with the essentials: a table for studying, a chair, and a small woofer for some entertainment. I knew I wanted to buy them second-hand to save money, but finding sellers was incredibly difficult. I walked around town, asked friends, and checked notice boards, but it was a frustrating and time-consuming process. I thought to myself, "There has to be a better way."</p>
        <p class="about-story">I couldn't find the items I needed, but I did find an idea. I decided to develop this website, Kabale Online, to solve the very problem I was facing. My goal was to create a simple, free, and centralized place where students, families, and anyone in Kabale and the wider Kigezi region could easily connect to buy and sell second-hand goods. I wanted to help other students who were in the same situation I was in, and to empower local residents to make some extra money from items they no longer needed. This platform is built for our community, by one of its own.</p>
