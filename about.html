            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p class="about-story">My journey with Kabale Online started when I was reporting for my first year at university. I had very little money, but I needed to furnish my small room with the essentials: a table, a chair, and a small woofer. I knew I wanted to buy them second-hand to save money, but finding sellers was incredibly difficult. After a frustrating search, I realized our community needed a central, trusted place to connect.</p>
            <p class="about-story">I decided to develop Kabale Online to solve that very problem. This platform is my solution for all the students, families, and residents of the Kigezi region who are looking for a better way to trade. It's built for our community, by one of its own.</p>
