                <p>Honesty and clear communication are key to successful sales. As a seller, you agree to:</p>
                <ul class="icon-list trust">
                    <li><strong>Describe Accurately:</strong> Provide truthful, detailed descriptions of your items, including any flaws, damages, or defects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Real Photos:</strong> Post clear, recent photos of the actual item you are selling. Stock photos are not permitted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate Fairly:</strong> Respond to potential buyers promptly and politely. Do not pressure them into making a purchase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sell Legitimate Items:</strong> You must own and have the legal right to sell every item you list.</li>

                <p>Your safety is our top priority. We've created these guidelines to protect you from scams and ensure a positive experience:</p>
                <ul class="icon-list safe">
                    <li><strong>Meet in Public & Safely:</strong> Always arrange to meet sellers in a well-lit, public place during the daytime if possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspect Before Paying:</strong> Thoroughly check the item to ensure it works and matches the seller's description *before* any money changes hands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay Only Upon Exchange:</strong> Never send advance payments, especially through mobile money. Pay only when you have received the item.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If a deal feels too good to be true, a seller is being evasive, or you feel uncomfortable for any reason, it's okay to walk away.</li>
                </ul>
